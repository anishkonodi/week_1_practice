step1: read external marks
step2: read internal marks
step3: read project marks
step4: if external internal and project marks is greater than 50 
step5: compute (10*internalscore)/100 and store to variable called internal
step6: compute (20*external score)/100 and store to the variable called external
step7: compute (70* projectcore)/100 and store to the variable called project
step8: compute total score= internal +external+ project 
step9: if total score is >=90 print A grade
step10: if total score is >=70 and <= 90 print B grade
step11: if total score is >=50 and <=70 print C grade
